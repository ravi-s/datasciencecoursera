## Details
The repository contains 2 R scripts and a text file:
 
1. **run_analysis.R**
2. **readData.R**
3. **variable.txt**

run_analysis.R is the master script that uses the functions defined in readData.R

##Notes:
1. Please make sure you use source R function to load the readData.R file before running the master script.

2. variable.txt file contains my assessment of mean and std variables used for final data summary.
